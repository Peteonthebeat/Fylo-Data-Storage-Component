### What I learned

The main thing I learned is using CSS triangles from various css generators. I also got exercise some basic flexbox and grid skills.

.white-box::after {
content: "";
position: absolute;
bottom: -20px;

    right: 0;
    /* left: calc(50% - 20px); */
    border-style: solid;
    border-width: 0 25px 25px 0;
    border-color: transparent white transparent transparent;

}
